Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit JCR-RMI -- Version 2.0.0

Introduction
------------

This is the 2.0.0 release of the JCR-RMI subproject of Apache Jackrabbit.

JCR-RMI is a transparent Remote Method Invocation (RMI) layer for the
Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR) version 2.0. The layer
makes it possible to remotely access JCR content repositories and is
compatible with all JCR 2.0 implementations.

Changes and Known Issues
------------------------

JCR-RMI 2.0 is a major upgrade from the earlier 1.x releases. The most
notable changes in this release are:

  * Upgrade to JCR 2.0. Both client and server sides of the RMI layer now
    use the JCR 2.0 interfaces.

  * Upgrade to Java 5. JCR-RMI now requires Java 5 as the base platform.

  * Removal of the jackrabbit-api and jackrabbit-jcr-commons dependencies.
    The only dependencies of JCR-RMI are now the JCR 2.0 API and the Java 5
    platform.

  * Modified support of XA transactions. Instead of implementing the
    org.apache.jackrabbit.api.XASession interface, JCR-RMI now makes the
    client session implement the javax.transaction.xa.XAResource interface
    directly whenever the server session does so.

The biggest known issues in this release are:

  * Interoperability with JCR 1.0 clients or servers is not supported.
    You will need to use 1.x versions of JCR-RMI for remote access to
    JCR 1.0 repositories.

  * Many new JCR 2.0 features and interfaces are not yet supported by the
    JCR-RMI layer. Please check the implementation if you want to use an
    interface or method signature that was not included in JCR 1.0.

  * The Jackrabbit API extensions are no longer supported. Most notably
    remote node type registration does not work in JCR-RMI 2.0.0. Other
    extensions like workspace creation can now be accomplished with the
    equivalent standard JCR 2.0 API.
