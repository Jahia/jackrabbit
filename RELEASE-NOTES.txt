Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.0.0

Introduction
------------

This is Apache Jackrabbit 2.0.0, a fully compliant and production-ready
implementation of the Content Repository for Java Technology API, version 2.0
(JCR 2.0, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/summary?id=283).

Changes in this release
-----------------------

Jackrabbit 2.0 is a major upgrade from the earlier 1.x releases. The most
notable changes in this release are:

  * Upgrade to JCR 2.0. This Jackrabbit release implements and is based
    on the official JCR 2.0 API. All of the features required by the
    JSR 283 specification have been implemented. Note that the remote
    access layers (RMI and WebDAV) only support a subset of JCR 2.0.

  * Upgrade to Java 5. All of Jackrabbit (except the jcr-tests component)
    now requires Java 5 as the base platform. Java 1.4 environments are no
    longer supported.

  * Separate JCR Commons components. Many of the general-purpose JCR
    components like OCM are now developed and released separately from
    the Jackrabbit content repository. See the individual components
    for their most recent releases.

  * Database connection pooling is now available for all database backends.
    Non-pooled versions of the bundle persistence managers are still
    available in the org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle package.
    To enable connection pooling in an existing Jackrabbit repository,
    replace the package name with org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.pool
    in your repository and workspace configuration files.

  * Data store feature enabled in the default repository configuration.

  * Full text indexing with Apache Tika. Jackrabbit can now extract and
    index the full text content of many new types of documents, including
    the Office Open XML files produced by Microsoft Office 2007 and higher.

  * Apache Commons Collections, Apache Derby, Jetty, SLF4J and Apache Xerces
    dependencies have been upgraded to more recent versions.

  * OracleFileSystem class does not use special blob handling anymore as it
    is not required for Oracle versions since 10R1. Use the Oracle9FileSystem
    class if you need support for Oracle 9 or earlier.

Jackrabbit releases, please see the Jackrabbit issue tracker at

Backwards compatiblity
----------------------

Jackrabbit 2.0 is designed to be compatible with existing Jackrabbit
1.x clients and repositories. The main exceptions to this goal are:

  * Removal of deprecated classes and features. Jackrabbit 2.0 is not
    backwards compatible with client code that used classes or features
    that had been deprecated during the 1.x release cycle. Most notably
    the temporary org.apache.jackrabbit.api.jsr283 interfaces have been
    removed in favor of the official JCR 2.0 API in javax.jcr.

  * Repositories that have used the new JSR 283 security features included
    as a development preview in Jackrabbit 1.5 and 1.6 may face problems
    when upgrading to Jackrabbit 2.0. See especially JCR-1944 and JCR-2313
    for more details.

  * The JCR-RMI layer no longer implements the Jackrabbit API extensions.
    Code that uses JCR-RMI with distributed transactions or for administration
    operations like creating workspaces or registering node types needs to
    be updated accordingly.

  * The JCR-RMI layer in Jackrabbit 2.0 only supports JCR 2.0 repositories.
    To access a JCR 1.0 repository implementation like Jackrabbit 1.x over
    RMI, you need to use the 1.x versions of JCR-RMI.

Please contact the Jackrabbit user mailing list or issue tracker for more
information on how to handle the upgrade if you face some of these issues.
