Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.2.0

Introduction
------------

This is Apache Jackrabbit(TM) 2.2, a fully compliant implementation of the
Content Repository for Java(TM) Technology API, version 2.0 (JCR 2.0) as
specified in the Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283).

Changes in this release
-----------------------

Jackrabbit 2.2 is an incremental feature release based on the earlier
2.x releases. The most notable changes in this release are:

  * Performance improvements. The performance of features like access
    control, user and group management, concurrent read/write operations
    and join queries have been notably improved. A performance test suite
    was added to track improvements and prevent regressions.

  * Deprecation of old persistence managers. All non-bundle persistence
    managers and also non-pooled bundle database persistence managers have
    been deprecated in preparation for potential future changes of the
    persistence layer. All the deprecated persistence managers will remain
    functional and supported in future 2.x releases, but will most likely
    be removed in Jackrabbit 3.0.

  * Better thread-safety. Significant effort has been spent on making
    Jackrabbit more resilient against various kinds of concurrency issues.
    Most notably Jackrabbit no longer assumes that clients will follow the
    JCR specification in not using a single session concurrently from multiple
    threads. Doing so is still not recommended, but it's no longer likely to
    cause significant trouble.

  * Switch from log4j to Logback. The default Jackrabbit deployment
    packages (jar, war, rar) now use Logback instead of log4j for improved
    logging functionality. Thanks to the SLF4J logging framework it is still
    easy for downstream deployments to switch to another logging backend for
    example if support for existing configurations is needed.

  * Over 150 other fixes and improvements.
